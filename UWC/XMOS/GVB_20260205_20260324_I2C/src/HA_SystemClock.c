/*! \brief This function changes the prescaler configuration.

 *  Change the configuration of the three system clock

 *  \param  PSAfactor   Prescaler A division factor, OFF or 2 to 512 in
 *                      powers of two.
 *  \param  PSBCfactor  Prescaler B and C division factor, in the combination
 *                      of (1,1), (1,2), (4,1) or (2,2).
